# Tectostress application
Stress inversion webapp

This webapp allows you to perform stress inversion using the Tectostress algorithm. Any data you provide will be processed to estimate the stress tensor and its uncertainties. Data can be uploaded in CSV format, and the app will guide you through the process of selecting the appropriate columns for the inversion. Types of data include focal mechanisms, GPS displacements, and other geophysical measurements. It includes features for visualizing the results and exporting them in various formats. Through internet access, the app can also fetch data from external sources like the USGS.
