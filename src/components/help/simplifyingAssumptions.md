# Simplifying Assumptions

 We hypothesize that the stress tensor is homogeneous at the outcrop scale and that deformations and relative block rotations are small. Under these assumptions, we can calculate by an inverse method the stress tensor that best fits the data set, which gathers multiple microstructures formed under a unique tectonic phase (striated faults, joints, stylolites, etc). The orientation of each microstructure is interpreted in terms of the stress tensor, constraining the orientation and potentially the relative magnitudes of the stress principal axes in a specific way.
